# The Stack

Starting 2015, we're unifying our developer stack in terms of server and client side technologies and libraries we use for **new** projects (current projects that do not use this stack will not be affected but this formalism)

## Support/infrastructural technology

- anything they need to work. NGinx, AWS, IIS, Perl, Sinclair VPN tunneling, you name it.

## Service endpoints without client UI

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
- [Express](http://expressjs.com) or [Hapi](http://hapijs.com), depending on how strict the server behaviour needs to be

## User-facing apps

Mobile first, including taking into account low-fi, no-fi, or dollars per megabytes, and localization.

### Server side

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
- [Express](http://expressjs.com)
	- associated packages for
- `npm` for dependencies

Ideally, no server-side templating (ejs, nunjucks).

### Client side

- views: [React](http://facebook.github.io/react), with [jsx](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) templating
	- hinting is available in the form of `jsxlint`
        - [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/05/06/flux.html) as app framework on top.

- single page app routing, where applicable: [Page.js](http://visionmedia.github.io/page.js)?
- cloud data: [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com)?
- `npm` for client libraries
- [`browserify`](http://browserify.org) as bundle/build tool
- CSS will use [LESS](http://lesscss.org)
- Offline/lo-fi: [appCache](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/appcache/beginner)?
- localization: [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com) and ... something ... ?

Open question: how do we effect the smallest possible data footprint in conjunction with high pagerank?


## Static Sites

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (like gh-pages)

## testing and CI

- [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org)
- [`gulp`](http://gulpjs.com)
- linting and hinting for anything that can even remotely be hinted and linted.
