# User Testing

Cycle:

USER TESTING =>
    BUGS FILED =>
    TRIAGE =>
    IMPLEMENTATION =>
    DEPLOYMENT =>
    USER TESTING =>
        ...

## Dev responsibilities
* Devs should learn about the user testing process and know how their work fits into the general user testing schedule
* Devs need to triage/augment tickets filed from user testing
* Dev cycle needs to communicate "change log" to people designing user testing scripts
    * we can automate this (CI)

## Design responsibilities
* Designers need to be aware of and refer to change logs when creating new user testing scripts
* Designers should issues in github for each observation, preferably one issue for one major observation (if possible)
    * todo: examples of good tickets, bad tickets
