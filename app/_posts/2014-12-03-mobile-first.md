## Process
As much of our future audience may have only experienced the web through their
mobile devices, anything user-facing should be mobile from the first speck of
an idea onward. This means getting stakeholders and designers on board with a
mobile-first attitude, so we don’t end up with desktop content just squished
down into a mobile box.

## Devices

There are hundreds upon hundreds of device sizes on the market, and it is
unrealistic to try to target each of them. For that reason, we have devised a
matrix of baseline and ideal devices that should be able to run and interact
with all of our products and sites.


|     OS     |      Baseline Version/Device       | Baseline Screen | Baseline ppi |      High-end Version/Device        | High-End Screen | High-end ppi |
|------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Firefox OS |             v1.3/Tarako            |  320px × 480px  |              |             v2.1/Flame              |  480px × 854px  |      163     |
|   Android  |          v4.2/Huawei Y600          |  480px × 854px  |     196      |            v4.4/Nexus 4             |  768px × 1280px |      318     |
|    iOS     | v7.x/iPhone 5 & iPod Touch (5 Gen) |  640px × 1136px |     326      | 8.x/iPhone 6 & iPod Touch (6th Gen) |  640px × 1136px |      326     |

*note: we need to do some research and update the “screen” column above to a
“viewport” column*

Every engineer should have a FFOS and Android device to test on. Contact your
manager if you do not have access to either to test.

### Styles

Any style not surrounded by a media query should be explicitly for small screen
mobile viewports. Take advantage of cascading styles and build larger viewports
on top of that mobile base with `@media (min-width: …)`. DON’T use
`@media (max-width: …)`.

CSS3 offers a wealth of new styles and interactions. This can hopefully
eliminate the need for some images and heavy-handed javascript. Utilise new CSS
features as much as possible, while checking <http://caniuse.com/> for
compatibility with our target devices and browsers.

Reading on a small screen can be very difficult. Make sure font sizes are always
large enough to read at a reasonable distance on mobile viewports. 16px is
generally considered safe, but take advantage of user testing when available to
confirm.

Since designing and building for mobile means designing and building for
flexibility, the px measurement should only be used to declare font size on the
root (html) element. From there, `rem`s, `%`s, and `em`s should be used to size
elements.
