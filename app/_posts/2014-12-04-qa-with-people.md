# Quality Assurance with People

## User acceptance scripts

When implementing new features, it can be useful to have an accompanying user interaction script. This script is essentially a step by step process that should be executable by a person using the new feature for it to be considered successful.

An example would be:

1. Click on the "Terms of Use" button. A modal window will appear with more information.
2. Scroll through all the terms of use displayed in the window. An "I agree" button should appear once you reach the bottom of the copy.
3. Dismiss the window by clicking the "I agree" button.

## Design review

When implementing a newly designed feature the developer should flag a designer for a design review. This functions essentially the same as a code review with the reviewer providing feedback and either an R+ or R-. Ideally the designer that created the comps should be flagged, but if they're too busy another member of the design team can be flagged.

## User testing
