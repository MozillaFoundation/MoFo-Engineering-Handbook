Undoubtedly, this guide and how we develop, as well as all the other tooling, links, and context you are processing as a noob will take a little while to digest...but this guide will be here for you throughout!

Contained in the guide you are reading, we will list out a lot of different tools, services, and processes we use to ship snazzy software!  Let's get started!
