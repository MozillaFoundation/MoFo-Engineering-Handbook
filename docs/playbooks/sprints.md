# How we plan regular sprints

- Our sprints take 2 weeks, starting with sprint planning on tuesdays
- the monday before sprint planning has a sprint retrospective.

## sprint planning

- any outstanding work from last sprint gets moved to new sprint
- last sprint's stretch goals are evaluated and either moved into the new sprint or pushed out
- sprints are a mix of new work and maintenance/tech debt
